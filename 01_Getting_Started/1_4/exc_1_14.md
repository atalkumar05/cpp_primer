### Exercise 1.14

**Q:** Compare and contrast the loops that used a `for` with those using a `while`. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

**A:**  
Both `for` and `while` loops are used for iteration, but they serve slightly different readability and usage purposes:

- ✅ **`for` loops** are ideal when:
  - The number of iterations is **known in advance**
  - All loop control (initialization, condition, increment) fits cleanly into one line
  - Example: iterating from `i = 0` to `i < 10`

- ✅ **`while` loops** are better when:
  - The number of iterations is **not known**
  - You want to keep the loop condition separate from initialization/increment logic
  - Example: looping until a user enters "exit"

**Conclusion:**  
- Functionally, both are equivalent—you can write any `for` as a `while`, and vice versa.
- Use the one that makes your code **clearer to read** based on the situation.
